- Investigate the data. A manual segmentation has been made of fat and meat in a single image
for each day â€“ have a look at day 1. (On DTU Learn code is available for loading data, making
histograms, etc.).
- What is the spectral distribution of meat and fat respectively?
- Is it a reasonable assumption that each pixel is either meat or fat?


- Calculate the threshold value t for all spectral bands for day 1.
- Calculate the error rate for each spectral band.
- Identify the spectral band, which has the best discriminative properties for meat and fat.
- Classify the entire image of the salami for day 1, and visualise it.

- Calculate the multivariate linear discriminant function as described in (23) for day 1.
- Calculate the error rate (disagreement between the model and the annotations) for the training set.
- Classify the entire image of the salami for day 1 and visualise it.


- Classify fat and meat for the remaining days with the models trained on day 1.
- Calculate the error rate for the annotated areas for the remaining days. How is the performance of
the two models?
- Classify again the entire images for the remaining days and, and visualise them. Judged on the
visualisations, which model performs best?

- Judging from the images, which day would you choose to train on and why??
- Train the linear discriminant function on day 1, day 6 and so on, and for each day calculate the
error rate on all the other days.
- Show the error rate for all days (5 training days x 4 test days = 20 error rates) in an appropriate
plot or table.
- Why do we exclude the day we have trained on from the comparison?
- Which day is the best to train the model on, and why?
- What are the error sources in the model? Can we trust that the calculated fat and meat content in
the salami is the same as the real content?


- Incorporate this information into your linear discriminant model
- Does it change your estimates?
